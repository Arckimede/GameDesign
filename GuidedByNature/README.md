## 🧭 Overview
**Guided by Nature** is an open-world terrain prototype inspired by *Ghost of Tsushima* and *Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice*.  
The project explores how **environmental design**—through lighting, weather, wind and terrain composition—can naturally guide the player’s movement and attention **without UI markers or objectives**.

Built using **Unity 2022.3** and **Gaia Pro 2023**, the world encourages free exploration, immersion and appreciation of natural beauty.

## 🎮 Features
- 🌳 **Open world** terrain created with Gaia Pro  
- 🌊 **Natural guidance** via rivers, mountains and foliage motion  
- 🔉 **Ambient audio**: wind, water, and environmental soundscapes  
- ⚙️ **No HUD, objectives or UI distractions** — pure exploration

## 🌏 Design Philosophy
The focus of *Guided by Nature* is **readability and flow**.  
Contrast, composition and atmospheric cues lead the player intuitively from one area to another, mirroring how we follow signs of life and motion in the real world.

### Core Goals
- Demonstrate how **environmental cues** can replace explicit navigation  
- Show that **exploration alone** can be satisfying gameplay  
- Emphasize **mood, simplicity and immersion** over complexity
